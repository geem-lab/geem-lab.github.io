## Faculties

**Dr. Giovanni F. Caramori** 
Giovanni  studied chemistry at the Faculty of Philosophy, Sciences, and Letters of University of São Paulo, in Ribeirão Preto-SP, Brazil, and received his Ph.D. from the same university in 2006 under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Sérgio E. Galembeck. In the same year, he started a post-doctoral period with Prof. Dr. Gernot Frenking at the Philipps-Universität Marburg, Germany. In 2008 he returned to Brazil and joined Prof. Ana Maria da Costa Ferreira's group at IQ-USP. In 2009 he became an assistant professor at the Federal University of Santa Catarina, wherein 2010 he founded the GEEM group. In 2013 he started a second one-year period as visiting professor working with Prof. Gernot Frenking. Among other honors, Giovanni was named in 2017 affiliated member of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences ([Link](http://www.abc.org.br/2017/08/11/ufsc-recebe-novos-membros-afiliados-da-vice-presidencia-regional-sul-da-abc/)). In 2018 was promoted to associate professor of physical chemistry at the Chemistry Department of the Federal University of Santa Catarina, where he teaches disciplines such as General chemistry, physical chemistry, python coding, and quantum chemistry. He coordinates the GEEM group together with Prof. Dr. Luis Henrique S. Lacerda and is passionate about classical music, particularly classical guitar music, dedicating himself to playing it in his free time.

**Dr. Luis Henrique S. Lacerda**
Luis holds a degree in Chemistry from the State University of Ponta Grossa (2012), a Master's degree in Applied Chemistry from the State University of Ponta Grossa (2015) and a PhD in Chemistry from the State University of Ponta Grossa (2019). He completed a post-doctoral internship under the PNPD-CAPES program at the State University of Ponta Grossa (2019-2020) and the State University of Campinas (2020-2022) with FAPESP funding. He is an adjunct professor in the area of physical chemistry at the chemistry department of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) and co-leader of the Molecular Electronic Structure Group (GEEM). Likewise, he has experience in chemistry and physical chemistry, working mainly with computer simulations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) to study the chemistry of materials, drugs and other organic compounds, magnetic materials, organometallic coordination compounds, supramolecular chemistry, polymers, catalysis and photocatalysis. His current research interests focus on the study of intelligent materials for technological, environmental and biological applications.

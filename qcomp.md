##Qcomp

Qcomp is a newsletter for the dissemination of Computational Chemistry, inside and outside the Chemistry department of the Federal University of Santa Catarina. 
The central objective is to popularize and demystify computational chemistry, particularly in terms of theoretical foundation, conscious use, and applications 
to elucidate chemical problems. The target audience is undergraduate, and graduate students, who are inside or outside UFSC. 
Qcomp in its initial volumes presented only articles written in Portuguese, but after its entry in the Red Latinoamericana de Físicoquímica Teórica, 
RedLatFQT, it started to publish articles in Spanish and English.
